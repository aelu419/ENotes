# Book
- Arora Sanjeev, Barak Boaz: *Compoutational Complexity: a Modern Approach*

# Overview
- problems can be computable/uncomputable
- *def.* **efficiency**: how the number og basic operations in an algorithm increases against problem scale
- certain classes of problems do not have efficient algorithms yet

# Notation
- `[n]` denotes the sequence `1, ..., n`
- "P(n) for sufficiently large n" means there is some finite N where P(n) iff n>N
- $S^n$ strings of length n
- $S^*$ set of all strings
- $xy$ or $x \circ y$ string concatenation
  - $x^k$ repetition of the same string x
- $x \odot y$ binary string dot product (mod 2)
- $\llcorner x \lrcorner$ object x as represented as binary string
- $f=O(g)$ if
  - $f, g: \mathbb{N \to N}$
  - $\exists c: f(n)\leq cg(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$
  - $f=\Omega(g) \iff g=O(f)$
  - $f=\Theta(g) \iff (f=O(g) \land g=O(f))$
- $f=o(g)$ if
  - for all $\epsilon > 0$, $f(n)\leq \epsilon g(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$
  - $f=\omega(g) \iff g=o(f)$
