# Intro
- a **shell** is a program converting keyboard input to OS operations
- a **terminal emulator (terminal)** opens a window and lets users interact with a shell program

# File System Intro
- root directory `/`
- tree structure (only one tree, no drive letters like in Windows)
- the current directory (working directory) can be returned by `pwd`
- change directory `cd`
  - relative paths not starting with `/`
  - absolute paths starting with `/`
  - `cd ~` goes to current user home
  - `cd ~<user name>` goes to specific user home
  - `cd -` goes to last
- Linux is case sensitive and do not care about file extensions
- list directory `l`
  - to see hidden items (those with names beginning with `.`, such as the `.git` directory), use `ls -a` instead of `ls`
  - recursive `-R`
  - long format `-l`
- `less` program: displaying a text file
- `file` program: recognize the type of a file
## System Structure
- `/boot`: Linux kernel and boot loader
- `/etc`: configurations for the system, all as text files
  - `/etc/password`
  - `/etc/fstab`: mounted drives upon system boot
  - `/etc/hosts`: network host names and IP known to the system
  - `/etc/init.d`: startup services for the system
- `/bin`: system programs
  - `/usr/bin`: user programs
- `/sbin`: system admin programs
  - `/usr/sbin`: super user programs
- `/usr`
  - `/usr/share/X11`: X Window System
  - `/usr/share/dict`: bulit-in spellchecker resources
  - `/usr/share/doc`, `/usr/share/man`: help files
  - `/usr/local`: for installation of programs outside the official distribution
    - commonly, install program in `/usr/local/bin`
- `/var`:files that change as the system runs
  - `/var/log`
  - `/var/spool`: queued files like email and print jobs
- `/lib`: shared libraries (often as symlinks, see later)
- `/home`: for personal files of the user
- `/root`: for the super user's personal files
- `/tmp`: for programs to write temporary files
- `/dev`: devices available for the system
- `/proc`: an entirely virtual directory where each item is some facet of system running status
- `/media`: for automatic device mounting, different from `etc/fstab` that is for system booting

# File Manipulation
## Wildcards
- match conditions for system (and other supporting) commands
- `*` matches any number of characters
- `?` matches any single character
- `[characters]`: matches any of the characters
- `[!characters]`: matches any character *not* in the list
- **POSIX character class**
  - `[:alnum:]`, `[:alpha:]`, `[:digit:]`
  - `[:upper:]`, `[:lower:]`
  - *ex.* `*[![:lower:]]` any string that does not end with a lower case letter
## Copy
- usage 1: `cp file1 file2`
- usage 2: `cp file... dir`
- usage 3: `cp -R dir1 dir2`

## Move
- usage 1: `mv file1 file2` (renaming)
  - the same applies for directories
- usage 2: `mv file... dir`

## Remove
- usage 1: `rm file...`
- usage 2: `rm -r dir...`

## Make Directory
- `mkdir dir...`

# Commands
- commands can be
  - executable program
  - built-in command for the shell
  - shell function
  - alias (user-defined commands that reference other commands)
## Commands for Commands
- `type command` returns the type of the command, like built-in, alias, etc.
- `which` finds the executable program (or multiple locations for that same identifier)
- `help` provides instructions for built-in commands
- `man` provides documentation for executable programs

# I/O Redirection
- by default, standard output is directed to the commandline
  - `> file` redirects standard output to a file starting from the beginning
  - `>> file` redirects but appends instead of  overwriting
- similarly, standard input can be redirected
  - `< file`
- **pipelines** redirect the prior command's standard output to the standard input of the next command
  - `ls -l | less` gives a scrolling view to the `ls` output
- **filters** process standard input and writes to standard output
  - usually used in pipelines
  - `sort`, `uniq`, `fmt`
  - `grep`: selects lines containing certain pattern matches
  - `pr`: insert page breaks, headers, and footers for printing
  - `head`, `tail`: selects top/bottom part of the text
  - `tr`: character translations like converting to upper/lower, etc.
  - `sed`: stream editor, more advanced `tr`
  - `awk`: programming language for constructing filter

# Expansion
- *def.* intermediate steps the shell does that translate typed input to literal input
## Types of Expansions
- **pathname**: expands wildcards
- **tilde**: expands `~` to the user-specific directory
- **arithmetic**: whole number arithmetic operations
  - *ex.1* simple: `$((1 + 2))`
  - *ex.2* compound: `$(($((1 + 2)) % 3))` or equivalently `$((((1 + 2)) % 3))`
- **brace**: create multiple strings from brace contents
  - `{A, B, C}` $\to$ `A B C`
  - `{A{1, 2}, B{3, 4}}` $\to$ `A1 A2 B3 B4`
  - `{1, 2}{3, 4}` $\to$ `13 14 23 24`
- **parameter**: (see more discussion in later sections)
  - substitutes variables with their values
  - `$USER` $\to$ whatever username the current session belongs to
  - to show environment variables in a list, use `printenv`
  - `${VAR:-"DEFAULT VALUE"}` expands while providing default value if not defined
  - `${}` is also valid, usually used to separate the variable from text
    - sometimes it's added just for stylistic purpose
- **command**: use output of a command as expansion
  - *ex* `ls -l $(which ls)` prints in long format the file associated with the `ls` command
  - pipelines can also be constructed within the command expansion
## Quotes
- double quotes
  - all special characters are treated as text, except
    - $
    - \
    - \`
  - for this reason variable, arithmetic, and other `$` expansions will still happen within the expression
    - *ex.* `"$((1+2))"` will still evaluate to `3`
- single quotes
  - suppresses *all* expansions

## Backslash
- `\`
  - eliminates special meaning of the subsequent character
  - commonly used on `$`, `!`, `&`, and space
  - note that the multiline command with `\` basically uses it to escape the LF character, for this reason `\` must be the last character of that line in the command (before the LF)
    - *ex.* 
      ``` bash
      ls \
        -R \
        .
      ```
      evaluates to `ls -R .`
- escape characters
  - `\n`, `\t`, `\\`
  - less common ones: `\a` (alert sound), `\f` (form feed for printers)

# Permissions
- Linux is a multi-user system (multiple users at *the same time*)
  - different users have different permissions to files and directories
  - permissions are listed in order of
    - file owner
    - group owner
    - other users
  - each listing contains `rwx`, each letter represented as a bit, totalling from 0 to 7
  - for example `777` means `rwxrwxrwx` in that everyone can read, write, and execute the file
  - for directories, `x` means enter instead of execute, and the overall pattern works the same
- `chmod permission file` changes the permission to the according number
  - *ex.* `chmod 755 myProgram` allows everyone to read and execute, but only the owner to write
## Temporary Super User
- `su` substitute user for the current user, for a small number of subsequent commands
- `sudo` (substitue user do) enters a session where the user is super user
  - usage 1: `sudo command` executes the single line under super user
  - usage 2: `sudo -i` simulates initial login and changes the current session to a root user session
## Change Ownership
- `chown user file`
  - need super user priviledge
  - changes the owner of the file to the designated user
- `chgrp group file`
  - changes group ownership
  - can only be run by the owner of the file/directory

# Job Control
- Linux is multi-tasking
  - several processes that simultaneously execute
  - the Linux kernel schedules processes on the processor
- `ps`: list processes currently  running
- `&`: background execution
  - *ex.* `xload &` executes xload in the background as a process
- to move a task to the background when it's currently running
  - `ctrl + Z` to suspend the task and return control
  - call `bg` to shift into background
- `kill`
  - `kill PID` kills the process (by sending `SIGTERM` (termination))
  - other signals include
    - `SIGHUP` hang up
    - `SIGINT` interrupt, similar to `ctrl + C`
    - `SIGTERM`
    - `SIGKILL` immediate termination by the Linux kernel, programs don't (and can't) actually listen for this signal
    - each signal has a numeric code associated with it
    - *ex.* `kill -SIGKILL 1234` kills the process with id 1234 immediately
      - alternatively, use `-9`
