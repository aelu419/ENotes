# Intro
- remember to change permission if the shell script does not run
- **shebang**: the first line of the file, indicating the program needed to interpret the file
  - `#!/bin/bash` means the file should be run by `/bin/bash`
- comments: `#` makes the rest of the line a comment
- to run, navigate to the directory and call `./script_name.sh`
  - to run without the directory complication (in the current session), add the script to `$PATH` and `export`
    - `export PATH=$PATH:directory_name`
  - alternatively, move the script to `~/bin`, this applies to all sessions *after* the current session, unless this session is explicitly refreshed
  - then, run by calling `script_name.sh` directly
- scripts don't actually have to end with `.sh`

# Editing Scripts

## Environment
- for login shell sessions, the environment is configured when the bash program starts, in order of
  - `/etc/profile` global config script for all users
  - `~/.bash_profile` personal startup file for user
  - `~/.bash_login` alternative naming, read if `.bash_profile` does not exist
  - `~/.profile` another alternative naming, if the previous two do not exist
    - this is actually the default for Debian-based distros
  - typically, the `.bash_profile` exports the `PATH` with the added user home bin
- for non-login shell sessions, the following are read in order
  - `/etc/bash.bashrc`
  - `~/.bashrc`

## Alias
- `alias left=right`
- commonly, `alias short="some longer command"`
  - for long commands that are still simplistic enough

## Shell Functions
- for more complex functions
- defined functions are referencable within the same session (in a script, the script execution itself could be seen as a session within the current session)
  - *ex.*
    ``` bash
    today() {
        echo -n "Today's date is: " # echo without new line at the end
        date +"%a, %B %-d, %Y"
    }
    ```
    - invocation: `today` (no parenthesis)
  - *ex.2* single line function
  ``` bash
  today()
    date +"%a, %B, %-d, %Y"
  ```
## Here Script
- additional form of I/O redirection to include multiline text
- form:
    ``` bash
    command << token
    this is a line of input
    this is second line of input
    yet another line of input
    token
    ```
  - here, `token` can be anything as long as they are exactly the same and do not collide with any reserved words
  - traditionally, `token` is `_EOF_`
- to ignore tabs, use `<<-` instead of `<<`
  - *ex.*
  ``` bash
  cat <<- _EOF_
    This line should start without tab.
    Same with this line.
    And this line as well.
  _EOF_
  ```
    - example use: `./write_lines_to_file >> file.txt` will write the three lines to `file.txt`

# Variables
- naming
  - start with a  letter, no embedded spaces, no punctuation
- declaration
  - `variable=value`
    - no spaces allowed
    - quotations can be used for the value
    - `$variable`  can be used for the rest of the script
- environment variables can be referenced by `$`
- empty declaration: `variable=`

# Command Substitution and Constants
- command expansion can be used to evaluate command output to value
  - *ex.* `time_now="$(date)"`
  - usually, command substitutions are closed by double quotes to prevent splitting by whitespace
- constants
  - mark as `readonly` upon declaration (although rarely used)
  - usually variables are just "understood as" constant by the programmer when they are in all caps, although they are actually variable
  
# Functions

## Basics
- function stub
  ``` bash
  not_yet_implemented() {
    echo "function not_yet_implemented"
  }
  ```
> the tutorial goes over certain commands for retrieving system info, each of them are wrapped in a simple function where the output is the command's result itself plus some formatting
## Flow Control
### If
- full form
    ``` bash
    if commands; then
        commands
    # square brackets here denote optional, not test (see test below)
    [elif commands; then
        commands...]
    [else
        commands]
    fi
    ```
  - note the semicolon placements as line separators
  - technically it is possible to do without semicolons, but it permits the `then` to be on the same line
- can be compact
  `if commands; then do_stuff; fi`
- each condition is evaluated using its exit status (see next section)
- indentations are not actually required

### Switch (Case)
- general form
  ``` bash
  case word in
    patterns ) commands ;;
  esac
  ```
- *ex.*
  ``` bash
  #!/bin/bash

  read character
  case $character in
    1 ) echo "one"
        ;;
    2 ) echo "two"
        ;;
    3 | 4 ) echo "three or four"
        ;; 
    * ) echo "default"
        ;;
  esac
  ```
  - note the "default" case is actually just wildcard

### While
- general form
  ``` bash
  while command; do
    loop_body
  done
  ```
  ``` bash
  until command; do
    loop_body
  done
  ```

### For
- overall form
  ``` bash
  for word in words; do
    loop_body
  done
  ```
  - *ex.1* `for i in word1 word2 word3`
  - *ex.2* `for i in $(cat file)` number of words in a file
  - *ex.3* `for i in "$@"` list of command line arguments
    - note that if the `in words` is omitted, this example form is assumed to be default (`for i` is equilvalent to the example)

## Temporary Files
- it is good practice to write temporary files to under `$TEMP_DIR`, usually with the program name and some other identifier like timestamp
  
# Exit Status
- by convention, `0` is success and other values indicate error codes (`1` to `255`)
- to view exit status, use `echo $?` after a previous command
  - *ex.*
    ``` bash
    true
    echo $? # prints 0
    ```
- to exit the current script, call `exit exit_state`
  - by default the script terminates with `0` (success)
  - note that this `exit` is the exit for the entire script, not just the function
  - for functions, the return value is specified by `return exit_state`, with the same `0 ~ 255` range

## Test
- form 1: `test expr`
- form 2: `[ expr ]`
  - note that the space between the brackets and the expression is *required*
- flags
  - `-e`: file exists
    - `-d`: file is directory
    - `-f`: regular file
    - `-L`: symbolic link
  - `-r`, `-w`, `-x`: readable, writable, executable
  - `file1 -nt file2`: newer than
  - `file1 -ot file2`: older than
  - `-z str`: empty string
  - `-n str`: non-empty string
  - `str1 = str2`: equality
  - `str1 != str2`: inequality
  - *ex.* `if [-f .bash_profile ]; then echo "bash profile exists"; fi`
- other uses
  - testing for superuser priviledge: `[ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]`
    - first, the user id is expanded within the double quotes
    - then, the value is treated as a string and compared with `0` under equality
- a modern replacement for `[` is `[[`, which is less broadly supported but generally safer with/without quoting
  - `[[` supports regex matching and other nuanced operations

# Errors
- to print an error, redirect with `>&2`
  - *ex.*
    ``` bash
    if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then
        echo "you are not super user" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ```
  - upon redirection failure, it redirects again to standard output
- using `if` statements to handle errors
  - `if command` checks the exit status of that command
- using control operators
  - `A && B` B is executed only if A succeeds
  - `A || B` B is executed only if A fails
  - `A && B || C` if A then B, otherwise C (if B is guaranteed to succeed)

## Handling Signals
- `trap arg signals...`
  - *ex.* `trap "rm $TEMP_FILE; exit" SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM`
    - deletes the temporary file at $TEMP_FILE when the program is stopped from a signal
    - `SIGKILL` or `9` cannot be listened to
  - because only one argument is allowed `trap` is usually used with a cleanup function
    - *ex.* `trap clean_up SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM`

## Common Issues
- empty variable used in test without wrapping
  ``` bash
  foo=
  if [ $foo = "1" ]; then; fi
  ```
  - here, `$foo` first expands to empty string, and then `test` tries to interpret  ` = "1"`, printing an error about unary operators
  - the fix is to close `$foo` in double quotes, this way the expansion is `"" = "1"`

## Debugging
- use `-x` when running a command to see each line ran
  - lines are prefixed with `+`, the command's standard output isn't prefixed
- turn tracing on/off *within* the script by using `set`
  - `set -x` turns tracing on
  - `set +x` turns tracing off

# Keyboard Input
- `read variable` takes from standard input into `variable` until a line break is received
  - without `variable`, `read` will write to `$REPLY` (environment variable)
  - `-p prompt`: prompt before variable
  - `-t time`: automatic timeout
  - `-s`: secret text

# Arithmetics
- arithmetic expansion `$((expr))`
  - space is ignored within `expr`
  - only integer operations
  - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
  - within `expr`, variable references do not need `$`
    - *ex.* `$(( a + b ))`

# Positional Parameters
- arguments can referenced from `$0` to `$9`
  - call program with `prog 1 2 3`
  - `$0` has the value `prog`, `$1` has the value `1`, etc.
  - `$#` holds the value of argument count
- `shift` moves each argument's position down by 1
- commandline options
  - *ex.* 
    ```bash
    # reads all args in sequence
    while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
        # reads the top arg
        case $1 in
            # read the next arg when the file flag is currently being processed
            -f | --file )           shift
                                    filename="$1"
                                    ;;
            
            # set variables
            -i | --interactive )    interactive=1
                                    ;;
            

            # for other (invalid) flags, print usage
            * )                     usage
                                    exit 1
        esac

        # read the next commandline arg by moving the position down
        shift
    done
    ```
- the same applies for shell function invocations
  - calling: `function arg1 arg2`
  - receiving:
    ``` bash
    # note the arguments aren't being defined here
    function() {
        # $0 is reserved for the function name
        echo "$1"
        echo "$2"
    }
    ```
