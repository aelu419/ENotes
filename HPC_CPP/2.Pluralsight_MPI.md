# Scales
- many processes on many machines/devices
  - different CPUs on a network
  - several machines with >1 GPU on a network
  - host CPU and Xeon Phi device (intermediate between CPU and GPU, for servers )
- same process on all devices (divide and conquer)
- IPC
  - send executables and data across intra/internet
  - handled by MPI (Message Passing Interface)
- implemented by different vendors (Microsoft, Intel, etc.)

# MPI
- Open MPI
- on single device, use mpirun on the compiled executable instead of running directly
  - process counts can be specified in the mpirun command
  - for example `mpirun -np 3 --oversubscribe ./Main`
