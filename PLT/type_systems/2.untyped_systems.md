## Grammar
- definition of a simple grammar
    ```
    t ::=
        true
        false
        if t then t else t
        0
        succ t
        pred t
        iszero t
    ```
- `::=` signifies the beginning of definition of some terms
- `t` is a **meta-variable** which acts as placeholder for any term
  - the **object language** is the actual programming language being defined
  - the **meta language** is the notation (such as the above segment) that defines the language
    - `t` is a variable of this meta language
  - **term** is used interchangeably with "expression"; a program is just a term w/ the above grammar
    - *ex.* `iszero pred(succ(0));` evaluates to `true`
    - the `()` and `;` here are **abstract syntax** that is not defined in the terms
- any integer is the abbreviation of some minimal combination of `0`, `succ`, and `pred`

## Syntax
- the grammar is a *compact* notation for the full, inductive definition of the language
  1. $\{true, false, 0\} \in \mathcal{T}$ these basic symbols are always in the language
  2. if $t_1 \in \mathcal{T}$ then $\{$`succ t1, pred t1, iszero t1`$\} \in \mathcal{T}$ defines all unary operations of a term to be in the language
  3. if $t_1, t_2, t_3 \in \mathcal T$ then `if t1 then t2 else t3` $\in \mathcal T$ defines all ternary operations of three terms to be in the language
- note that the language is the smallest set satisfying the rules
- the alternate notation uses **inference**
  ![](../../res/types_and_pl/3.1.png)
  - the top 3 without premises are called **axioms**
  - each *inference rule* is actually a **schema** since it occurs in the metalanguage and involves metavariables
  - each schema translate to some set of **concrete rules** by substituting metavariables with actual occurrences
- another alternate is the inductive rule for constructing the language
  ![](../../res/types_and_pl/3.2.png)
  - $S_1$ includes all the constants, $S_2$ adds all the first-level expressions (immediately evaluated based on constants), etc., until for some $S_n$ the process terminates for a particular program
  - $S = \bigcup_i S_i = S_n = \mathcal T$
  > the last S=T part is proven in the book via strong induction
  - $S \subseteq S_{i+1}$
- the book goes over several characteristics as result of this inductive construction
  - the set of all constants appearing in some term $Const(t)$ has properties like $Const($`succ t1`$) = Const($`t1`$)$
  - the **size** of term `t` has properties like $size($`succ t1`$) = size($`t1`$) + 1$
    - when `t1` is incorporated in some layer, `succ t1` is incorporated in the next layer
    - for multiple metavariables in a term like in if/else, their sizes are *summed* before `+1`
  - the **depth** is defined similarly, but for multiple metavariables their depths are *maxed* before `+1`
  - the later a term is introduced, the larger size and depth it has
  - constants always have size and depth of `1`
  - $|Const(t_1)| \leq size(t_1)$
- strong inductions can be done on size and depth (*ex.* instead of $n$, use some term $s$ and all terms $r$ with $size(r) < size(s)$)
- **structural induction** is where for term $s$ the terms $r$ are immediate subterms of $s$
- the general scheme of such inductive proofs is

## Semantic Styles
- **semantics** is the evaluation of the actual terms in the language, with three basic approaches
  - **operational** approach defines an *abstract machine* for the language where machine code is directly taken from the language (instead of some lower level microprocessor command)
    - for term `t` (which could just be the program itself), the semantic of `t` is the final state of the abstract machine when the initial state is `t`
    - the book predominantly uses this approach
  - **denotational** approach is more abstract, in that it aims to find math *domains* of values for which terms can be interpreted against
  - **axiomatic** approach is direct, in that it takes the laws that define the language *as* the semantic
    - what a term means *is* what could be proven about it
- definition of a boolean grammar
  ![](../../res/types_and_pl/3.4.png)
  - `t` section defines all terms similar to the previous sections
  - `v` is a subsection of `t` that defines all terms that could act as final values
  - on the right, each blob is a rule in the format `t1 -> t2` (`t1` evaluates to `t2`)
    - the first two rules are called **computation rules**
    - the last rule is called **congruence rule**, namely specifying that the `if`'s guard can be evaluated first (it determines *where* to evaluate)
  - an **instance** of an inference rule is a rule where the metavariable is replaced with an actual term
    - *ex.* `if true then false else true -> false` is an instance of `E-IFTRUE` where `t2`=`false`, `t3=true`
  - a rule *satisfies* a relation if its conclusion is in the relation or one of its premises is not in the relation
  - the **one-step evaluation relation** $\to$ is the smallest relation satisfying the evaluation rules of the language
    - `tRt'` means the evaluation `t -> t'` is **derivable**
    - in the boolean case, something derivable means it is either an instance of the computation rules, or an instance of `E-IF` whose premise is derivable
    - tracing derivability will create a tree structure
- proof by **induction on derivations**
  - traverses the derivability tree
  - *ex. thm.* prove: $(t \to t' \land t \to t'') \to t' = t''$ in the case of the boolean grammar
    - if the last rule used to derive `t -> t'` is E-IFTRUE, then `t` must have the form `if true then t2 else t3`
      - this means the last rule for `t -> t''` cannot be E-IFFALSE
      - `t -> t''` cannot be E-IF either, because the guard is `true` which does not evaluate to anything different
      - for this reason `t -> t''` is an instance of E-IFTRUE
      - the same rule applied to the same `t` can only end up with the same conclusion, so `t' = t''`
    - ... repeat for different cases of the last rule of `t -> t'`
  - *def.* for some premise on an evaluation statement $P(t \to t')$,
    - if
      - if all possible derivation trees leading to $t \to t'$ causes $P(t \to t')$ to be true
    - then $P(t \to t')$ must be true in general
- a **normal form** `t` has no applicable evaluation rules
  - t is normal form $\iff$ t is a value
- a **multi-step evaluation relation** $\to^*$ relates a term to all terms derivable from it in 0 or more single evaluation steps
  - this relation is the reflexive, transitive closure of the one-step $\to$, hence the notation
- *thm.* normal forms are *unique*, in that if `t ->* u`, `t ->* v`, then `u=v`
  - this is a direct result of the `t'=t''` theorem above for `->`
- *thm.* every term can be evaluated to a value
  - *i.e.* for every `t` there is some normal form `t'` where `t ->* t'`
- incorporation of natural numbers values in the `nv` section
  ![](../../res/types_and_pl/3.5.png)
  - note `pred` is only used to cancel out `succ`, and it cannot go below `0`
- a term is **stuck** if it is in normal form but is not a value
  - all stuck terms evaluate to an `error` value
- note: the book uses **small step** notation when defining evaluation rules
- the **big step** notation directly states which terms evaluate to what
