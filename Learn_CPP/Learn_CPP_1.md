# Characteristics of the C/C++ Language

- Compiled
- "Trust the programmer" principle: low level, high performance, precise memory control
- Wide compatibility for ANSI C (C89) and ISO C (C90)

# Programming as Solving a Problem
1. Formulate the problem
2. Determine *how* to solve the problem
   * a good solution is clear, modular, well-documented, and robust
3. Program (``.cpp`` files)
4. Compile (``.cpp`` $\to$ ``.o``)
5. Linking (``.o``, ``stdlib``, ``other libraries`` $\to$ ``.exe``)
6. Test
7. Debug
