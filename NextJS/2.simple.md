# Creating the App
- `create-next-app`, using the `nextjs-blog` template and several other configurations

# Navigation

## file structure based routing
  - `pages/<rel>.jsx` is by default mapped to `/rel`
  - *ex.* [example routed page](2.simple/nextjs-blog/pages/frouted.jsx)
  - use of the `Link` component as alternative to `a` (for routes within the app)

## clent-side navigation
  - enabled by using `Link`
  - doesn't reload the webpage, just replaces DOM elements with JS (completely on client side)
  - in contrast `a` does cause page reload
  - the `Link` tag signals for code pre-fetching (from the destination module) to the Next compiler

# Assets, Metadata, CSS
- images are optimized at runtime, not build time
  - fits different devices
  - `Image` component
  - extension of the html `img` tag with props
  - note that image optimization is not possible for static sites (unless with vanilla NextJS)
- `Head` component as replacement of the HTML `head` tag
  - metadata (title, icon, etc.)
  - internal tags of `Head` work the same as `head`
- the `html` tag itself can be modified from `pages/_document.jsx`
- third party JS
  - `Script` component from `next/script` that replaces the html `script`
  - `Script`s can be specified
    - with `src`
    - with the `lazyOnload` strategy (`strategy` prop field)
    - with some function for `onLoad`
