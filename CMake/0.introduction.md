# Purpose
- build, test, and package software
  - the configuration step generates platform-native make files and accompanying settings
  - the build step makes use of the current environment to build the actual executable/libraries

# Project Structure
- project directory
  - `CMakeLists.txt`
    - : requirements
      - *ex.* `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)`, `project(MyProject VERSION 0.1.0)`
  - build
    - this is the **binary directory**
    - :x  within this directory, run `cmake ..` to have cmake output to `build` while referencing the cmakelists in the project directory
      - this *configures* the binary directory
      - after configuring, the binary directory itself can be passed to cmake instead of the directory holding the cmakelists
- alternatively, use
  - `ccmake` with cache and configuration in terminal ui
  - `cmake-gui` with modern ui

# Hello World
- see 0.minimal and 1.config for usage

## Executable
- in the list, `add_executable(exe_name src)`
  - *ex.* `add_executable(helloWorld main.cpp)`
- `cmake --build <path to build directory>`
  - run from anywhere, as long as the build directory is already configured
  - produces `build/helloWorld.exe`
  - alternatively just run `make`

## Configuration
- `configure_file(input output)` is used to copy the input as the output in the built project, while substituting variables in the input to their values in the output
  - mark variables with ``@VAR@`` or ``${VAR}``
- to make the configured file linkable, use `target_include_directories(target_name MODE directory)`
  - directories can be substituted with interpolated string
  - *ex.* `"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}"`
  - mode can be `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `INTERFACE`
    - these are used similar to C++'s accessbility keywords upon inheritance
    - each target is associated with a `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property and an `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property
    - the `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` apply to the target itself, similar to a `private` scope
    - the `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` apply to other targets dependent on the current target, similar to a `public` scope
    - each mode append the output to different properties uniquely
      - `PUBLIC` appends to both
      - `PRIVATE` appends only to `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` (i.e. within the scope of this target)
      - `INTERFACE` appends only to `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` (i.e. only for dependent targets, but not the current target)
    - in this context, a *dependency of* is like an *inheritance from*
- use `set(variable_name  value)` to set things like CXX version

## VS Code
- run `> Cmake: Configure` and choose `kit`
