# Standard Shader Features
- metallic parameter
  - when using texture, reads from A channel
- the gloss texture is usually stored in the A channel of the main texture
- occlusion map
  - darker for "valleys"
  - greyscale
  - usually computed in the modeling software via static ray-tracing
  - this is different from lightmap's occlusion factor, and also SSAO
  - note that tje occlusion map only applies to a single pose, for an animated model it may not always stay accurate
- metallic vs. specular workflow
  - by default, the standard shader follows the metallic workflow, where metallic materials (when enabled in the material's parameters) use the `albedo` for specular reflection color
  - for dielectric materials, the specular reflection reflects the same color as the incoming light
  - unity provides a separate "Standard (Specular Setup)" shader that exposes the specular color setting, this enables certain non-PB effects by setting specular colors for non-metallic materials

# Standard Shader Source
- in the `DefaultResourcesExtra` folder
  - `Standard.shader` and the `StandardSpecular` shader
- 9 passes
  - forward base, forward add
  - shadow caster
  - deferred
  - meta (extract information for lightmapping and global illumination)
  - the other 4 are repeats of the previous passes but for shader model 2.0
  - each pass contains some `#pragma` statement naming the vertex and fragment shaders used
- at the end of the code, the shader specifies a custom editor that the standard shader uses
  - to view editor, go to built-in shaders folder and find `Editor/StandardShaderGUI.cs`
- the standard shader uses several structures for packing data between passes
- 4 important lights per vertex, and then other lights are computed as spherical harmonics
  - this is not the same as light probes
  - light marked as `unimportant` will automatically be harmoics
  - lighting data is interpreted from Unity-injected data
- `UnityStandardBRDF.cginc` includes several shading equation component implementations
  - Cook-Torrance specular shading (references The Blinn-Phong Normalization Zoo article)
    - Disney diffuse model (references the Physically Based Shading at Disney article)
      - the original proposal as caused by lambertian lighting being too dark on rough material edges
      - "out artists liked it"
      - basically in addition to $c_{dif}/\pi$ some Fresnel(Schlick)-like adjustment term were multiplied in order to brighten up rough surfaces
      - this is not energy conserving!
    - GGX visualization (V) and distribution (D)
  - the final shading equation combines
    - diffuse lighting 
    - specular lighting
    - GI specular lighting
- within the standard shader, directives are used to adapt the shader for linear/gamma color spaces
- note that the combined effect of these is that Unity as an engine has a unique "look"
  - non-PBS, brighter, etc. as opposed to the more photorealistic looks of Unreal, Frostbite, ...

# Surface Shader
- Unity-specific, but going out of support (replaced by SRP)
- code-generator approach to handle different light types and other settings, for which boilerplate would need to be written
  - for example, repeating the same thing between point and directional lights
- structs (`in UnityPBSLighting.cginc`)
  ```
  struct SurfaceOutputStandared {
    fixed3 Albedo;
    float3 Normal;
    half3 Emission;
    half Metallic; // 0: non-metal, 1: metal
    half Smoothness;
    half Occlusion;
    fixed Alpha;
  }
  ```
  - this is for the standard workflow, the user is reponsible for filling this out in the surface shader
  - additional channels can be put into this structure as long as certain naming conventions are respected
  - when `o.Normal` is written to, the `o.worldRefl` and `o.worldNormal` will NOT be updated automatically
    - specific procedures will need to be added to force update
- the surface shader can be created as an asset
  - there is no `Pass` specification, only the `SubShader`
  - `#pragma surface <surface_shader_program> <light_model> <shadow_model>`
  - `#pragma target 3.0` to select shader model 3 or above
  - the input must be `struct Input` with `float2 uv_Maintex`
    - must match exactly
  - the surface shading program
    ```
    void surf (Input IN, inout SurfaceOutputStandard o) {
        // ... compute o.Albedo, o.Metallic, o.Smoothness, o.Alpha
        // these are fed into the lighting model
    }
    ```
- the standard (metallic) light model takes `SurfaceOutputStandard`, `viewDir`, and `UnityGI` (containing both GI and vertex lighting information) and outputs a color
