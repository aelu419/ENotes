# Programmable Components
- programmable vertex processor, programmable fragment processor
- general purpose

- GPUs become
  - closer to CPU in function
  - more data formats than float (int, etc.)
- focus on fixed-size vectors and matrices

- main data types
  - per-instance data (ex. per-vertex position)
  - per-pixel interpolated data (including gradients)
  - per-batch data (ex. light positions), i.e. *uniform*  data

- specialized instructions (as of GeForce6)
  - DOT, EXP, LOG
  - Recipricals: RCP, RSQ (reciprical square root, but not normal square root)
  - trigs: SIN, COS
  - swizzling (swapping xyzw)
  - write masking (only write specified channels)
  - "free" negation
- the Shader Model defines an abstraction for GPU architecture, specific platforms vary

# Vertex Shader
- transfroms to clip space
- calculate per-vertex lighting for Gouraud (not popular anymore)
- Inputs
  - vertex position, texcoords, uniforms 
  - output to fragment shader 
- usually less expensive since it is per  vertex
- IN: constant float registers, vertex stream from vertex data registers, temporary registers, loop and address registers
- OUT: position, texture, flg, diff. color, spec. color, output pt size
- no stack, just streams

# Optimization
- don't try to optimize too much without cross-platform testing
- HLSL usually get compiled to LLVM-like assembly, which is then implemented by the platform
  - the exact cycle-count depends on the device and driver
- in general, it is good to shift work from fragment shader to vertex shader if possible

# Pixel Shader
- determine fragment's color per pixel
- IN: uniforms, sampler registers, temporary registers
  - samplers can do bilinear and other sampling techniques as configured
- OUT: color, depth

# HLSL/Cg
- simplified C without memory handling and call stacks
- no JMPs in general, sometimes function calls are just inline insertions done by the compiler
## Uniforms
- usually, game engines predefine various `uniform`s
- values come from external source, sometimes injected by engine
- stored in constant register in the GPU
- same for all processed vertices / pixels in the entire shading process
- semantics (not in C/C++)
  - `VertexPos : POSITION`
    - `VertexPos` is the custom name
    - ` : `  denotes association
    - `POSITION` is from GPU hardware register
      - similarly,  `TEXCOORD0`, `NORMAL`, etc.
- Unity supports up to 16 `TEXCOORD`s
- **glue**
  - binds a shader program to the rest of the graphics pipeline
  - connects the semantic variable to the pipeline

## Operators
- ShaderModel4+: bitwise logic operators like C, modular `%`
- No pointer support and indirection (`->`)
- `mul` interpretations
  - *def.* row vector: $1 \times n$, column vector: $n \times 1$
  - `mul(v, M)` denotes
    - $M^Tv$ with a column vector $v$
    - $vM$ with a row vector $v$
  - `mul(M, v)` denotes
    - $Mv$ with a column vector $v$
    - $vM^T$ with a row vector $v$
- for this reason, vectors and matrices are rarely transposed
  - instead, people rearrange multiplications to achieve desired effect
- other library functions
  - `dot`, `cross`,  `distance`
  - `lerp`: $t$ doesn't need to be 01
  - `lit`: calculates Blinn-Phong diffuse and specular lighting
  - `mul`
  - `normalize`
  - `saturate`: clamp01
  - `reflect(incident, normal)`
  - `sincos(x, out s, out c)`: outputs both sine and cosine

# Unity Built-In Shader Source
- documentation is usually sparse/incorrect(out of date)
- source code for built-in shaders are published on Unity Archive
  - alternatively, go to the version page, and then go to archive -> additional -> built-in shaders
- CGIncludes
- DefaultResources
- DefaultResourcesExtra
## Interpreting the Shader
- the standard shader is an "uber" shader with components that are enabled/disabled upon need using directives
- the standard shader itself comprises mostly of `includes` to other shader components
  - components are in DefaultResourcesExtra with extension `.cginc` (Cg includes)
- in legacy shaders prior to Unity 4, built-in shaders are minimal and separate
- Unity switched to monolithic, physically based standard shader in Unity 4
- the course package mainly involves implementations of early Unity shaders with aid from *GPU Gems*
