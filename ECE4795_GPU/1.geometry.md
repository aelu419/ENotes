# Overview
- rasterization pipeline, as opposed to raytracing pipeline
- objects -geometry-processing-> display space -rasterization-processing-> image
- geomeetry processing mainly deals with floating points
- rasterization processing mainly deals with integers

# Coordinate Systems
- different handedness and axis depending on platform
- note object space does not follow the same thing with screen space, even within the same platform

# Geometry Format
- vertex in R3, normals in R3 per vertex
- vertex colors not often used anymore, texturing is more common
  - color buffer still exists but channels are often not actually used for color
- triangle list
  - each entry is ZxZxZ in the order following the platform's handedness
  - flipping the order yields the backside
  - handedness order is used to decide between different fragment normals

# Transforms 
> see RTR early chapters

# Backface Culling
- for triplet (pqr) mapping to points (abc), let v1 denote b-a, v2 denote c-a
- v1 cross v2 it the fragment normal
- dot the fragment normal with the eye vector and check against the sign
- culling is usually performed after world and view transforms in older platforms
- for newer GPU's, the branching for culling actually takes more resource in the middle of the geometry pipeline
  - it is cheaper to connect all the preprocessing together and pass all triangles through it
  - culling introduces some comparison at the end that doesn't perform well
  - culling becomes the last stage in geometry processing, before sending to rasterization
