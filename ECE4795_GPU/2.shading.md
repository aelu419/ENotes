# Basic Lighting
- PBR
  - originally from CG movies, moved gradually to games
  - unifies lighting pipeline
    - properties are materially-based which is more unified than custom 
  - characteristics
    - linear space lighting
    - energy conservation
    - reciprocity
    - mettalic/dielectric distinction
    - 'everything is shiny' (specular lighting to some extent)
    - 'everything has fresnel'
    - optional:
      - high definition render buffers
      - tonemapping to handle high dynamic range
- common light sources
  - directional light: infinitely far away, parallel rays
  - point light: emit in all directions
  - spot light: emit within a cone with some falloff
- vector notation
  - $\vec n$ normal from the vertex upwards
  - $\vec l$ lighting from vertex to light
  - $\vec v$ view from vertex to eye
  - $\vec h$ halfway from vertex to between light and eye (arithmetic average of $\vec l$ and $\vec v$, computed as $(\vec l + \vec v)/|\vec l + \vec v|$)
  - $\vec r$ reflectance from the vertex to the mirror of the light against the normal
  - *everything is normalized*
- diffuse lighting
  - rough surface scatters incoming lightsource
  - the camera can always see the lighting as long as the surface itself is visible
  - $c_{light} * c_{\textrm{mat, diffuse}}(\vec n \cdot \vec l)^{-}$
    - (using - to denote clamp 0)
  - for bidirectional reflectance, $c_{light} * \pi BRDF(\vec l, \vec v) (\vec n \cdot \vec l)^-$
    - for the classic model, $BRDF = c_{\textrm{mat, diffuse}}/\pi$
    - note that $\pi$ here is specific for point lights, other light shapes may result in different coefficients
    - brdf aims to be physically plausible, as opposed to classical Blinn-Phong
      - energy conservation via reflection: incoming light with intensity 1 can only be reflected less than or equal to 1
      - note that this is  more complicated in global illumination schemes
- spot lighting is implemented differently
  - cg model: $((\vec l \cdot \vec d)^-)^f$ for light center direction $\vec d$, falloff factor $f$

# Rasterization
- Gouraud shading
  - intensity interpolation of vertices
  - most cards/libraries already implement this
  - the simplest kind of smooth shading, with minor artifacts when lighting is only calculated at vertices
    - newer models calculate lighting per pixel (or more) instead
      - Phong shading
- Z-Buffer
  - i.e. depth buffer

# Texturing
> see RTR chapter 6
> goes over text coords, sampling techniques (hardware), mip-mapping

# Advanced Texturing
> goes through bump & normal mapping
- environment mapping
  - sample the skybox at the direction of the reflection

# Color spaces
- linear vs. gamma
- certain engines do not support linear space directly, and needs additional instructions for conversion
