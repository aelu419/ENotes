# Overview
- memory management safety
  - compile-time checking
- C++-comparable performance and better concurrency support
> the tutorial goes over installing Rust on Linux using `rustup` and IntelliJ
- static and strongly typed
    - static: type checking active at compile time
    - strongly typed: enforces type assignment rules
- "one compile runs anywhere"
- stack/heap
  - more emphasized in Rust since memory safety is emphasized

# Program Structure
- `fn main` as entry point where `fn` defines a function
- macros are marked as `foo!`
- compiler hints such as `#![allow(unused_variables)]`
  - not commonly used, Rust compiler gives good warnings

# Data Types
- ``` rust
  let foo: foo_t = foo_val;
  ```
- types can be deducted when there is a RHS in the assignment

## Primitive Types
- `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, `u64`, ...
- to fit native architecture, use `isize`/`usize`
- `f32`, `f64` (i.e. what `double` is for other languages)
- `bool`: `true`/`false`
- `char` (unicode support)
  - assign with single quotes `'c'`
- compound types (fixed size)
  - array (homogeneous compound)
    ``` rust
    // explicit type
    let arr: [f32,4] = [a, b, c, d];
    // deduced type
    let arr2 = [a];
    // default value for large arrays
    let arrLarge = [0; 1000];

    // indexing
    let num = arr[0];
    ```
  - tuple (heterogeneous compound): 
    ``` rust
    // explicit type
    let location: (&str, isize) = ("Atlanta", 30000);
    // deduced type
    let location2 = ("Atlanta", 30000);

    // indexing
    let city = location.0;
    // destructuring
    let (cityname, zip) = location;
    ```

## Strings
- `String`: vector of `u8`, mutable, on the heap
  - initialize via `String::new()`
  - `String` variables needs to be marked `mut`
  - can be converted to string slice by
    - converting to a pointer like `&foo` of type `&String`
    - calling `String::as_str()` resulting in type `&str`
- `&str`: vector of `u8`, immutable, stored anywhere
  - *string slice*
  - can be converted to `String` via `&str::to_string()`
- by default, string literals are of type `&str`
- concatenating string slices
  - `[foo, ", ", bar].concat()` of type `String`, even if the components are `&str`
  - `format!("{}, {}", foo, bar)` of type `String`
    - note that this is a macro
- concatenating strings
  - `String::push_str(String)`
  - `String::push(char)`
  - `+(String, &str)`

# Variables
- discard variable: prefix with `_`
  - compiler does not give "unused" warning
- type convertion (non-narrow): `foo_val as bar_t`
- mutability
  - variables are immutable by default
  - mutable variables are marked by `mut`
    - *ex.* `let mut foo:i32;`
- scoping
  - blocks have scopes
  - inner scope declarations *hide* outer scope declarations (unlike C#)
    - aka. *shadowing*
